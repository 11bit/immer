/**
 * Immer takes a state, and runs a function against it.
 * That function can freely mutate the state, as it will create copies-on-write.
 * This means that the original state will stay unchanged, and once the function finishes, the modified state is returned.
 *
 * If the first argument is a function, this is interpreted as the recipe, and will create a curried function that will execute the recipe
 * any time it is called with the current state.
 *
 * @param currentState - the state to start with
 * @param recipe - function that receives a proxy of the current state as first argument and which can be freely modified
 * @param initialState - if a curried function is created and this argument was given, it will be used as fallback if the curried function is called with a state of undefined
 * @returns The next state: a new state, or the current state if nothing was modified
