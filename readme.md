# Immer

Immer (German for: always) is a tiny package that allows you work with immutable state in a more convenient way.
It is based on [_copy-on-write_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) mechanism.

The basic idea is that you will modify (a proxy of) the current state, and once that is completed, the copy will be finalized and form the next state.
As soon as a piece of the state is modified, it is copied. That is what one typically does by hand (in for example Redux reducers).

_This means that you can interact with your data by using mutations, will keeping all the benefits of immutable data_

The immer package exposes a single function:

`immer(currentState, fn: (state) => void): nextState`

## Example

```javascript
const baseState = [
    {
        todo: "Learn typescript",
        done: true
    },
    {
        todo: "Try immer",
        done: false
    }
]

const nextState = immer(baseState, state => {
    state.push({ todo: "Tweet about it" })
    state[1].done = true
})
```

The interesting thing about `immer` is that `baseState` will be untouched, but that `nextState` will reflect all changes made to `state`.

```javascript
// the new item is only added to the next state,
// base state is unmodified
expect(baseState.length).toBe(2)
expect(nextState.length).toBe(3)

// same for the changed 'done' prop
expect(baseState[1].done).toBe(false)
expect(nextState[1].done).toBe(true)

// unchanged data is structurally shared
expect(nextState[0]).toBe(baseState[0])
// changed data not (dÃ»h)
expect(nextState[1]).not.toBe(baseState[1])
```

## Reducer Example

A lot of words; here is a simple example of what difference that could make in practice.
The todo reducers from the official Redux [todos-with-undo example](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos-with-undo)

```javascript
const todo = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return {
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        completed: false
      }
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      if (state.id !== action.id) {
        return state
      }

      return {
        ...state,
        completed: !state.completed
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

const todos = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [
        ...state,
        todo(undefined, action)
      ]
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return state.map(t =>
        todo(t, action)
      )
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

After using immer, that simply [becomes](https://codesandbox.io/s/xl11qpo9mp):

```javascript
import immer from 'immer'

const todos = (state = [], action) =>
  immer(state, state => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'ADD_TODO':
        state.push({
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        })
        return
      case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
        const todo = state.find(todo => todo.id === action.id)
        todo.completed = !todo.completed
        return
    }
  })
```

Creating middleware or reducer wrapper that applies `immer` automatically is left as exercise to the reader :-).

## Limitations

* This package requires Proxies, so Safari > 10, no Internet Explorer
* Currently only tree shaped states are supported. Cycles could potentially be supported as well (PR's welcome)
* Currently only supports plain objects and arrays. Non-plain data structures (like `Map`, `Set`) not (yet). (PR's welcome)

## Pitfalls:

* Make sure to modify the state you get passed in in the callback function, not the original base state that was passed as first argument to `immer`!
